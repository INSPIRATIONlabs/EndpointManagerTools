# EndpointManager tools

This is the sourcecode for the EndpointManager tools APP. The goal is to provide helpful tools as a simple client side web application.

Current features:
- Convert network share Group Policy Objects into a Powershell script

Planned features:
- Create your own drivemap
- ?

## Features

### Intune network share mapping conversion
This tool converts an exported Group Policy XML from a OnPremises Active Directory into a Powershell script. The script detects network changes and tries to connect the network Shares based on the AzureAD / Active Directory Group of the User.

Instructions on how you can export the XML from your Active Directory can be found on the [website of the original version](https://tech.nicolonsky.ch/next-level-network-drive-mapping-with-intune/)

The App processes all data on your device and no Data will be uploaded which is one of the most significant changes to the original version!

The original version was provided as .NET application by Nicola Suter and the Powershellscript is completely his Code. You can find the original project on [Github](https://github.com/nicolonsky/IntuneDriveMapping).

## Getting Started

### Supported Browsers
- Edge
- Chrome

### Prequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (with NPM)
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

You should also be familiar with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) which we use for this project. This helps give you more guidance as you code from [intellisense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense) when using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Recommended Development setup

We recommend the following tools for your dev setup:

* Editor: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* Terminal: [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal-preview/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) or [hyper](https://hyper.is/)
* PWABuilder VSCode extension: [PWABuilder VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PWABuilder.pwabuilder-extension)
* lit-html VSCode extension: [lit-html VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.lit-html)

### Development

Run `npm install` and then run `npm run dev`, the starter should open in your default browser. From here you can start developing, your changes will be rebuilt and reloaded in the browser as you develop.

### Building for Production

Run `npm run build`, the `dist/` folder will contain your built PWA. The production build will also generate a pre-caching service worker using [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-precaching).

## Deployment and Packaging

### Deployment

Once your PWA is ready to deploy we recommend [Azure static website hosting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/publish-app-service-static-web-app-api/) for deploying your PWA.


### Packaging

Many app stores, including the Microsoft Store and the Google Play Store support PWAs. To package your PWA for deployment to these app stores head back to https://pwabuilder.com/, put in your URL and hit `Build My PWA`.


## Dual Screen support

The default layout of this starter is dual screen friendly. We do this [here](https://github.com/pwa-builder/pwa-starter/blob/master/src/script/pages/app-home.ts#L41) by using the [CSS Spanning API](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MSEdgeExplainers/blob/master/Foldables/explainer.md#proposal-css-primitives-for-building-dual-screen-layouts) to adjust the layout when the app is spanned on a dual screen device. As you start to build your PWA you can use these CSS features to ensure that your PWA looks good in all of the [dual screen postures](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dual-screen/introduction#dual-screen-overview). For more info on developing PWAs for dual screen devices you can check out the [Microsoft docs here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dual-screen/cross-platform/#build-web-experiences).


## Addons

### Microsoft Graph Toolkit

The [Microsoft Graph Toolkit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/toolkit/overview) is a collection of reusable, framework-agnostic web components and helpers for accessing and working with Microsoft Graph. The components are fully functional right of out of the box, with built in providers that authenticate with and fetch data from Microsoft Graph.

### Authentication

For Authentication you can use the [PWABuilder pwa-auth](https://github.com/pwa-builder/pwa-auth) web component. This component lets your users sign-in/sign-up using their Microsoft, Google, or Facebook account. Your app receives their email address, name, and profile picture. Built with ❤ by the PWABuilder team.

😎 Bonus: It's super lightweight, pulling in the authentication libraries only when the user tries to sign-in with one.

😎😎 Double bonus: It uses the new [Credential Management APIs](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/credential-management) to speed through sign-ins without bulky pop-ups or redirects.
